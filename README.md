# VolumeCalculator
A simple program that will ask the user for a shape (cube, pyramid or ellipsoid), take necessary dimensions and calculate the volume. The program will keep looping asking to calculate a new volume until the user chooses to quit.
## Dimensions Needed
Cube: Length of the side of a cube <br />
Pyramid: Base length and height <br />
Ellipsoid: 3 Radii
## Output
After the dimensions have been entered for any shape, the a message will prompt the user with the volume of that shape. When the user chooses to quit the program, the program will output every volume calculated with its corresponding shape in a sorted manner from lowest to highest.
